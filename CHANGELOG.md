# Venworks Core Utilities and Shared Objects

## Version 1.0.20
* To satisfy user demands even though this will make things hard for them in the long run, VenworksCoreConfig RTFP file has been moved to this library. 
* You will now have to create a empty mod and put the RTFP changes in it and that empty mod must live at the end of the load order. Where before you could have just simply edited the config file in the consuming mod. Sorry like I said you can't have you cake and eat it to. You guys wanted the hard way lol.
